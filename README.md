WordPress Starter
==================

This Compass extension provides support for creating WordPress Themes using Sass.

Installing
==========

    [sudo] gem install wordpress-starter

To install a theme into your existing compass project, add the following to your compass configuration file:

    require 'wordpress-starter'

Or, just run this command:

    compass -r wordpress-starter -f wordpress /path/to/installation

What this does is call `compass`, requires the wordpress-starter extension, uses the framework wordpress, sets the Sass output to be compressed and finally ends with you setting the theme name.
