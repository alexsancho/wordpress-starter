WordPress Starter
==================

This Compass extension provides support for creating WordPress Themes using Sass.

Installing
==========

    [sudo] gem install wordpress-starter

To install a theme into your existing compass project, add the following to your compass configuration file:

    require 'wordpress-starter'

Or, just run this command:

    compass -r wordpress-starter -f wordpress -s compressed /path/to/installation

What this does is call `compass`, requires the wordpress-starter extension, uses the framework wordpress, sets the Sass output to be compressed and finally ends with you setting the theme name.

Available patterns
==================

At the moment there are two available patterns,

The default pattern creates a blank project that only contains the included stylesheets, the command to use this pattern is:

	compass -r wordpress-starter -f wordpress -s compressed /path/to/installation

If you want to start with a blank theme, the command is slightly different,

	compass -r wordpress-starter -f wordpress/starter -s compressed /path/to/installation

this theme comes bundled with a few features that makes easier to start:

- Full HTML5+CSS3 markup
- Build with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and Susy grid framework [http://susy.oddbird.net/](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
- The theme is bundled with the [Slightly Modded Options Framework SMOF](http://aquagraphite.com/2011/09/29/slightly-modded-options-framework/), and include some known filters and actions that cleans and improves the output generated by WordPress
- All the code included tries to follow the [WordPress coding standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
